# Please read before you start!!!

## 2 file folders are provided for this coding exam.

- Development: contain the PSD file
- Preview: contains the mockups for the template and the elements

## What to do

Your task is to convert PSD file into a running WordPress theme.

Your code should make use of the latest available coding techniques (BEM and SMACSS) and technologies that you are capable of applying.

You may use preprocessors(optional) that compiles your source code into .html (e.g. pug, jade, haml), .css (sass, scss, less, stylus), and .js (browserify, coffee, babel and on).

The test should not exceed 8 hours. If incase you won't be able to finish the task in 8 hours time, please submit whatever output you have.

Before starting the test, create a repository in GitHub. Create your account if you don't have one yet. Do not commit anything yet.


## Create a file called my.log

When you are ready to begin coding, please push my.log file with a text "IN" in it as your initial commit and a commit message "IN". This will indicate your start time. 
And when you take a break push the my.log file with a text and a commit message "BREAK", "BACK" when you resume and "OUT" when you finish. 
Pushing development files excluding my.log file should be done the usual way.

## Functionalities:
- The header menu must stay at the top upon scrolling.
- The slider must slide right to left. It's up to you what script you may use.
